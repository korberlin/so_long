Welcome, adventurers and code enthusiasts! Iâ€™m excited to share with you my journey through the **so_long** project at 42 Berlin. This challenge ventures beyond simple coding and delves into the realms of 2D graphics, event handling, and game mechanicsâ€”all to create a delightful, interactive experience on the screen.

## About

**so_long** is not just another exercise; itâ€™s an immersive exploration into graphical programming with the **MiniLibX** library. By implementing a 2D game from scratch, Iâ€™ve sharpened my skills in:

- **Window Management & Event Handling:** Opening a window, capturing user inputs, and ensuring seamless interaction.
- **File Parsing & Map Validation:** Reading custom `.ber` map files, checking for correctness, ensuring walls surround the entire map, and verifying proper player, exit, and collectible placements.
- **Pathfinding & Algorithmic Thinking:** Using a **flood fill algorithm** to confirm that the player can reach all collectibles and the exit.
- **Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics (Bonus):** Infusing life into the game with sprite animations and directly displaying the score/move count on the screen.

Throughout this project, Iâ€™ve embraced the complexity of integrating logic, graphics, and user experienceâ€”all developed and tested on **Linux** machines.

## Project Highlights

- **Program Name:** `so_long`
- **Files Submitted:** Makefile, *.h, *.c, maps, textures
- **Makefile Rules:** NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
- **Input:** A `.ber` map file
- **Authorized Functions:** open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, math library functions, MiniLibX functions, ft_printf (or custom equivalent), and Libft functions.

## Core Mechanics

Your mission is simple yet engaging:
1. **Collect All Items:** Traverse the map and gather all collectibles (`C`).
2. **Reach the Exit:** Once you have all the items, head towards the exit (`E`).
3. **Respect the Terrain:** Walls (`1`) block your path, so plan your route carefully.
4. **Navigate Thoughtfully:** Use **W, A, S, D** to move up, left, down, and right.  
5. **Quit Cleanly:** Press **ESC** or close the window to exit the game gracefully.

The map characters:
- `0` - Empty space  
- `1` - Wall  
- `C` - Collectible  
- `E` - Exit  
- `P` - Player start position

**Path Validation:** If the map isnâ€™t validâ€”maybe itâ€™s not rectangular, not fully surrounded by walls, or lacks a reachable path to exit and collect all itemsâ€”the game will refuse to start, ensuring a solid foundation for an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Bonus Features

Why stop at the basics?
- **Sprite Animation:** Characters and elements come alive with animations, adding visual flair.
- **Score Display:** The current score or move count is displayed right on the screen, keeping you connected to your progress at all times.
