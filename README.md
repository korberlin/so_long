Welcome to my **so_long** project! üåçü¶à This is a basic 2D game developed using **MiniLibX**, where you guide a character through a map, collect all the items, and find the exit.

## About
**so_long** is a project from 42 Berlin designed to enhance your skills in:
- Window management & event handling with the **MiniLibX**.
- File parsing and validating map configurations.
- Pathfinding logic, using a **flood fill algorithm** to ensure the map is playable.
- Working with basic 2D graphics, sprite animation, and score displays.

Through this project, I learned:
- How to integrate and manage graphical elements in a C project.
- Techniques for validating maps (checking their shape, ensuring they are fully walled in, and that characters are correctly placed).
- Handling user input (W, A, S, D) for character movement.
- Implementing sprite animations for a richer visual experience.
- Displaying the current score directly on the screen for a more engaging gameplay experience.

This project has been tested on Linux machines.
